Several helper programs are provided to assist with the addition of
new elliptic curves. Note that these programs will not be needed if using
one of the supported curves. These programs must be build using the MIRACL
library. See source code for compilation instructions

bigtobig.cpp - converts to BIG number format
check.cpp - checks for optimal choice of number base
romgen.cpp - rough-and-ready program used to generate ROM files for
all of the different languages.
